# Movie Website
(Developed using html, css and js)


## About
1. Developed a Movie Site using html, css and js
2. Used API to fetch latest Movies data
3. You can hover the mouse over the movie to get the summary of movie
4. I have also provided a hyperlink to watch the movie
5. The link leads to Google Search for now
6. I have provided a search bar where you can search any movie with a keyword
7. Provided option to navigate upto 10 pages in order to browse more movies
8. Improvements which can be made: 
      * Use bootstrap to add more functionality to the website
      * Use a different API to include webseries, shows and sitcoms
      * Provide a link to a third party website where you can watch a movie
      * Instead of third party link, try to include movie on your website only
      * Some logic in js code can be improved for faster response from website
